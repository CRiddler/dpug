# UC Davis Python User Group

Welcome to the Davis Python Users' Group (D-PUG)!  We are a community of Python-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [python](https://www.python.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

We have no TAs - just mutual support from folks working on/in python and related topics. A group of D-PUG coordinators help organize and schedule worksessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

## Biweekly (every other week) Work Sessions

 When the ability to meet in person is an option, we'll likely be in 360 Shields Library (the Data Lab Space on the third floor of Shields Library, [see these directions and map](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/directions/).
