# UC Davis Python User Group

Welcome to the Davis Python Users' Group (D-PUG)!  We are a community of Python-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [python](https://www.python.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

We have no TAs - just mutual support from folks working on/in python and related topics. A group of D-PUG coordinators help organize and schedule worksessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

## Biweekly (every other week) Work Sessions

 - **Currently we'll meet on *{weekly meeting time}***
 
 When the ability to meet in person is an option, we'll likely be in 360 Shields Library (the Data Lab Space on the third floor of Shields Library, [see these directions and map](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/directions/).
