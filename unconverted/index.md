# UC Davis Python User Group

Welcome to the Davis Python Users' Group (D-PUG)!  We are a community of Python-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [python](https://www.python.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

We have no TAs - just mutual support from folks working on/in python and related topics. A group of D-PUG coordinators help organize and schedule worksessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

We offer weekly **drop-in studio** sessions where you can bring your questions to ask. Additionally we also offer **mini-workshops** every other week, where we cover intermediate python topics.

## Weekly Work Sessions
**Tuesdays 1pm-2:30pm PST**

D-Pug is Hybrid! Join us either on Zoom or in-person at 360 Shields Library (the Data Lab Space on the third floor of Shields Library, [see these directions and map](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/directions/).
